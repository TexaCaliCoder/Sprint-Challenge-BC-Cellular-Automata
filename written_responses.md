1. Describe the general process of how blocks are added to a blockchain.

Blocks in a block chain are added when a majority nodes in the associated de-centralized network match the hash sequence of the previous blocks using what is called a proof. Essentially the Proof  is like the "secret key" that is used in succession with the previous hash to distinguish whether the hashing sequence is valid. these blocks all start from the same genisis block. Each hash that is verified  among these nodes will be attached to some transactions and upon verification, processes those transactions as complete.

2. How can blockchain users mine coins?

Blockchain miners use a style called bruteforce to run through a series of guess and check functions for the Proof in order to hash the block correctly. Once there proof is verified they are rewarded with "coins".

3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.

Simulations such as conways game of life can be used to model many different solutions, like calculating the spread of infectious disease, the growth and decline  of populations, even down to image recovery by noticing patterns and replicating expected results.
